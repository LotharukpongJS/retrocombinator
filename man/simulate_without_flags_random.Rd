\arguments{
\item{num_seq}{The initial number of sequences to consider}

\item{seq_length}{The number of nucleotides in each of the sequences in the
simulation}

\item{point_mutation_model}{Which point mutation/substitution model will be
used to modify the sequences during the simulation? Options are "JC69" (Jules
and Cantor 1969), "K80" (Kimura 1980), "F81" (Felsenstein 1981), "HKY85"
(Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano, 1985), "TN93" (Timura and Nei 1993), or "GTR"
(General Time Reversible Model, Tavar√© 1986).}

\item{num_jumps}{How many steps we have in our simulation}

\item{timestep}{How much time passes in one jump (unit: millions of years)}

\item{burst_probability}{Probability that an active sequence bursts in one
timestep}

\item{burst_mean}{The Poisson mean for the distribution that specifies how
many new sequences an active sequence will create during bursting}

\item{max_active_copies}{The total number of sequences that have the ability
to burst that we allow in a simulation (if the number ever exceeds this
threshold, the simulation prunes the set of sequences by randomly choosing
the ones that live on)}

\item{recomb_mean}{The expected number of template switches during
recombination between two sequences (chosen from a Poisson distrubtion with
this as its mean).}

\item{file_out}{Where should the results of the simulation be saved? (This
can be parsed by input_file)}

\item{num_out_tags}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
tags (unique identifiers) of the sequences and their families}

\item{num_out_init}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
distance of each sequence to the initial sequence}

\item{num_out_seqs}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
raw sequences themselves}

\item{num_out_pair}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
pairwise distance between all pairs of sequences}

\item{to_randomise}{Should this simulation be run with a random seed to begin
with? (Based on system time)}

\item{to_seed}{Should this sequence be run with a specific initial seed? If
so, then the seed is specified by the parameter sseed}

\item{seed}{Refer to documentation of to_seed}

\item{sequence_numbering}{Where should the numbering (specifying "tags", or
unique identifiers) for sequences begin?}

\item{family_numbering}{Where should the numbering (specifying "tags", or
unique identifiers) for families begin?}
