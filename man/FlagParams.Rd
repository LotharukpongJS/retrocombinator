\usage{
FlagParams(
  lengthCriticalRegion = 10,
  probInactiveWhenMutated = 0.01,
  maxInactiveCopies = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lengthCriticalRegion}{How many positions (chosen randomly) in the
sequence are essential for the sequence to remain active (with the potential
to burst)? If the sequence experiences mutations in these areas, it loses its
activity with some probability}

\item{probInactiveWhenMutated}{What is the probability that a mutation in
the critical region causes the sequence to lose its bursting potential?}

\item{maxInactiveCopies}{The total number of inactive sequences that we
allow in our simulation (if the number ever exceeds this threshold, the
simulation prunes the set of sequences by randomly choosing the ones that
live on)}
}
