\arguments{
\item{init_seqs}{What are the initial sequences to begin the simulation with?}

\item{init_seq_index}{Which initial sequence from the set of init_seqs should
we use as the reference for comparing other sequences to?}

\item{point_mutation_model}{Which point mutation/substitution model will be
used to modify the sequences during the simulation? Options are "JC69" (Jules
and Cantor 1969), "K80" (Kimura 1980), "F81" (Felsenstein 1981), "HKY85"
(Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano, 1985), "TN93" (Timura and Nei 1993), or "GTR"
(General Time Reversible Model, Tavar√© 1986).}

\item{num_sensitive_posns}{How many positions (chosen randomly) in the
sequence are essential for the sequence to remain active (with the potential
to burst)? If the sequence experiences mutations in these areas, it loses its
activity with some probability}

\item{inactive_probability}{What is the probability that a mutation at a
sensitive position causes the sequence to lose its bursting potential?}

\item{num_jumps}{How many steps we have in our simulation}

\item{timestep}{How much time passes in one jump (unit: millions of years)}

\item{burst_probability}{Probability that an active sequence bursts in one
timestep}

\item{burst_mean}{The Poisson mean for the distribution that specifies how
many new sequences an active sequence will create during bursting}

\item{max_active_copies}{The total number of sequences that have the ability
to burst that we allow in a simulation (if the number ever exceeds this
threshold, the simulation prunes the set of sequences by randomly choosing
the ones that live on)}

\item{max_total_copies}{The total number of active and inactive sequences
that we allow in our simulation (if the number ever exceeds this threshold,
the simulation prunes the set of sequences by randomly choosing the ones that
live on)}

\item{recomb_mean}{The expected number of template switches during
recombination between two sequences (chosen from a Poisson distrubtion with
this as its mean).}

\item{selection_threshold}{What sequence similarity percentage to the
original sequence we wish to maintin (distant sequences are dropped over the
course of the simulation).}

\item{fam_proportion}{If this proportion of the overall sequence similarity
matrix falls below a certain percentage (fam_percentage), then we split the
current family into two families, and allow for recombination only within
families.}

\item{fam_percentage}{Refer to documentation for fam_proportion}

\item{file_out}{Where should the results of the simulation be saved? (This
can be parsed by input_file)}

\item{num_out_tags}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
tags (unique identifiers) of the sequences and their families}

\item{num_out_init}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
distance of each sequence to the initial sequence}

\item{num_out_seqs}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
raw sequences themselves}

\item{num_out_pair}{How many times across the simulation will we output the
pairwise distance between all pairs of sequences}

\item{to_randomise}{Should this simulation be run with a random seed to begin
with? (Based on system time)}

\item{to_seed}{Should this sequence be run with a specific initial seed? If
so, then the seed is specified by the parameter sseed}

\item{seed}{Refer to documentation of to_seed}

\item{sequence_numbering}{Where should the numbering (specifying "tags", or
unique identifiers) for sequences begin?}

\item{family_numbering}{Where should the numbering (specifying "tags", or
unique identifiers) for families begin?}
